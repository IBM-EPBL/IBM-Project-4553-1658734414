     <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">CHRONIC KIDNEY DIAGNOSIS DISEASE</h1>
     <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs. Each kidney is about the size of a fist. Your kidneys filter extra water and wastes out of your blood and make urine. Kidney disease means your kidneys are damaged and canâ€™t filter blood the way they should.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">
You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. If you experience kidney failure, treatments include kidney transplant or dialysis. Other kidney problems include acute kidney injury, kidney cysts, kidney stones, and kidney infections</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Before kidney failure occurs, patients have "chronic kidney disease" (CKD). Kidney (renal) failure is when kidneys don't work as well as they should, to the point where kidney replacement is required. Kidney replacement can be accomplished by different kinds of dialysis or by kidney transplant. The term "kidney failure" covers a lot of problems. These problems can result in kidney failure</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Kidney disease also increases your risk of having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long time. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life</p>
    <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">There are large number of people in the world who gets affected to kidney related diseases. Our country India ranks first in terms of people getting affected by kidney related disease. Though population plays a major factor in it the fact that China which has higher population than us is ranking much lower place than us in the term of people getting affected by kidney related disease. This is mainly due to the lifestyle and the food people eat to lead their life.</p>
   <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">So the reason we were doing this project is to find the       symptoms of kidney related diseases for the users and alert them before the disease becomes    fatal for the patient. The main motive of this project is to find the symptom and its cure as soon as    possible.</p>
